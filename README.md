# SoftwareForDiseaseSubtype
SAS macros and R functions developed by my team for Disease Subtypes/Molecular Pathology Epidemiology.
This R package implements an augmented inverse probability weighting method for the missing subtype (or competing risks) problems where the subtypes are defined by multiple markers and typically different sets of cases have missing values for different markers; that is, some cases with unavailable subtype data may have partial information about the subtypes due to missing data in some (but not all) of the markers. The statistical method uses all the data available including the cases with only partial biomarker data available, and enjoys the double robustness property.
